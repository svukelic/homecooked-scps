            <p>Full containment of SCP-2953 is currently impossible. Foundation efforts are focused on identifying affected individuals and providing appropriate psychological intervention.</p>
            
            <p>All licensed psychiatrists and clinical psychologists within Foundation reach have been provided with Protocol 2953-Differentiate, allowing them to distinguish between actual schizophrenic disorder and SCP-2953 effects. Mental health professionals are not to be informed of the anomalous nature of the condition but are instead told it represents a newly discovered psychological phenomenon requiring specialized treatment.</p>
            
            <p>Mobile Task Force Eta-8 ("Mind Doctors") monitors psychiatric hospital admissions globally for potential SCP-2953 cases. Confirmed cases are to be treated with a specialized cognitive behavioral therapy regimen developed by Dr. <span class="redacted">████████</span>, which has shown a 73% success rate in resolving the condition.</p>
            
            <p>Research into a method of preventing SCP-2953 transmission is ongoing at Site-19.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Description:</div>
            <p>SCP-2953 is a self-propagating cognitohazard that causes affected individuals to become absolutely convinced they have schizophrenic disorder despite showing no actual symptoms of the condition. The cognitohazard appears to spread through prolonged discussion about schizophrenic disorders or through exposure to detailed descriptions of the condition in clinical settings.</p>
            
            <p>The primary effect of SCP-2953 is a persistent and unshakeable belief that one is experiencing schizophrenic symptoms, particularly auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions. What makes SCP-2953 distinct is that affected individuals do not actually experience any hallucinations, delusions, or other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenic disorder. Brain scans, psychological evaluations, and behavioral observations all confirm normal cognitive function.</p>
            
            <p>However, subjects will adamantly insist they are hearing voices, seeing things that aren't there, or experiencing thought insertion, despite all evidence to the contrary. When questioned about specific hallucinations, subjects often provide vague, inconsistent, or textbook descriptions that appear to be based on their understanding of what schizophrenic disorder "should" be like rather than genuine experiences.</p>
            
            <p>Most notably, subjects will frequently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Claim to be hearing voices "right now" while showing none of the attentional shifts, pauses, or responses typically observed in actual auditory hallucinations</li>
                <li>Report that they are experiencing bizarre delusions but be able to reason normally about these same beliefs when engaged in unrelated conversations</li>
                <li>Describe their symptoms using terminology and concepts clearly derived from medical literature rather than personal experience</li>
                <li>Express frustration when others do not acknowledge their "obvious" symptoms</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>SCP-2953 appears to be transmitted when an unaffected individual engages in detailed discussion about the nature of schizophrenic disorders with an affected individual for more than approximately 30 minutes. The probability of transmission increases significantly if the unaffected individual is already concerned about their mental health or has a family history of mental illness.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 2953-1: Case Studies</div>
                <p><strong>Case #1:</strong> Subject A, a 34-year-old professor of psychology, began insisting he had developed schizophrenic disorder after teaching a seminar on psychotic disorders. Despite continuing to function normally in his academic position and personal life, Subject A sought multiple psychiatric opinions, each time describing textbook symptoms that were inconsistent with his observed behavior. When one psychiatrist suggested he might not have schizophrenic disorder, Subject A became distressed and accused the doctor of "gaslighting" him. Foundation intervention with Protocol 2953-Differentiate resulted in successful treatment after 6 weeks.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Case #2:</strong> Subject B, a 28-year-old woman with no prior psychiatric history, developed SCP-2953 after her roommate (Subject C) was affected. Subject B reported to emergency services that she was "hearing voices telling me to hurt myself," yet showed no behavioral indications of responding to internal stimuli. When asked to describe the voices in detail, Subject B provided inconsistent accounts and admitted she "couldn't actually hear them with [her] ears" but insisted they were "definitely real voices in [her] head." Foundation monitoring indicated that Subject B had spent several evenings discussing Subject C's condition before developing symptoms herself.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 2953-2: Researcher Notes</div>
                <p>Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span>, Lead Researcher: "What makes SCP-2953 particularly concerning is its ability to spread through the very discussions meant to diagnose or treat it. We've had to implement strict protocols for psychiatric professionals to prevent them from becoming vectors. The cognitive dissonance experienced by subjects is profound – they simultaneously lack actual schizophrenic symptoms while being utterly convinced they have them. Most troubling is how the condition leads subjects to research schizophrenic disorders extensively, making them more effective at 'performing' what they believe the condition should look like, which in turn makes diagnostic differentiation increasingly difficult."</p>

            <div class="addendum">
                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 2953-3: Transmission Experiment</div>
                <p>Under controlled conditions, D-Class subject D-7294 was exposed to audio recordings of an SCP-2953 affected individual describing their perceived symptoms for 45 minutes. Within 12 hours, D-7294 began reporting that he was "hearing voices" despite no observable indications of hallucinatory experiences. When staff intentionally ignored his claims, D-7294 began to make more dramatic statements about his "symptoms," eventually describing elaborate conspiracy theories that he claimed were his delusions. Cognitive testing showed normal thought processes, and D-7294 was able to engage in complex reasoning tasks without difficulty – a capability typically impaired in actual schizophrenic disorder.</p>
                
                <p>This experiment confirmed that SCP-2953 can be transmitted through recorded media, not just direct interpersonal contact, significantly complicating containment efforts.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 2953-4: Incident 2953-A</div>
                <p>On <span class="redacted">██/██/20██</span>, three Level 2 researchers assigned to documentation of SCP-2953 reported to the medical wing with symptoms consistent with SCP-2953 infection. Investigation revealed that all three had spent significant time reviewing and updating the SCP-2953 documentation file. Subsequent testing of 12 personnel who had accessed the complete file within the previous week revealed that 8 showed early-stage indicators of SCP-2953 effects.</p>
                
                <p>Analysis by the Memetics Department confirmed that the SCP-2953 documentation itself had become a vector for transmission, particularly the detailed case studies and symptom descriptions. This represents the first confirmed case of an SCP file itself becoming capable of transmitting the anomalous effect it documents.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 2953-6: Memetic Countermeasure Proposal</div>
                <p>Dr. <span class="redacted">███████</span>, Head of Memetics Division: "We face an unusual challenge with SCP-2953 documentation. We need to maintain accurate information for research and containment purposes, but the very act of documenting it creates new vectors for transmission. Our proposal is three-fold:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Implementation of a dynamic text algorithm that subtly alters descriptive language and specific examples each time the document is accessed, preventing any consistent memetic pattern from forming in the reader's mind.</li>
                    <li>Creation of a specialized anti-memetic primer to be read before accessing the document, which preemptively disrupts the cognitive pathways SCP-2953 typically exploits.</li>
                    <li>Development of documentation that retains critical information while utilizing specialized cognitive circuit-breakers – semantic structures that force the reader's mind to periodically reset and prevent cumulative memetic buildup.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>For example:</p>
                <p>[SAMPLE TEXT RESTRUCTURING]<br>
                Instead of writing: "Patients with SCP-2953 believe they hear voices despite showing no evidence of actual auditory hallucinations."</p>
                
                <p>The system will reformat to: "The silly brain-thinkers imagine ear-whispers but nobody's home! 🌈 THINK ABOUT PUPPIES NOW 🌈 Their noggins do the confused dance without the usual symptom-wompoms that doctors look for."</p>
                
                <p>Additional example: "The transmission vector appears to be prolonged discussion of schizophrenic disorder" becomes "Yackety-yak about the spooky brain-mixups makes the goofy idea-bug jump to new people! 🍦 COUNT TO TEN BACKWARDS 🍦 The thought-cooties spread when friendos chat too long about certain head-fuzzies."</p>
                
                <p>This approach disrupts dangerous cognitive pathways by forcing the adult mind to process childish language patterns and nonsensical interruptions, preventing the formation of the specific neural resonance patterns that enable SCP-2953 transmission while still conveying the essential information to trained personnel.</p>
                
                <p>We believe this approach could become a template for documentation of similar cognitohazards in the future, allowing us to study and contain them without perpetuating their effects."</p>
