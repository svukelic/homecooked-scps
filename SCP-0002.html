            <div class="section-title">Special Containment Procedures:</div>
            <p>No containment procedures have been established for SCP-0002 as all attempts to prevent or counteract the phenomenon have proven ineffective. Despite extensive research, no method to contain or neutralize the anomaly has been discovered. The Foundation has concluded that containment of SCP-0002 is currently impossible with available means and knowledge. Fortunately, no immediate danger to human life or societal stability has been detected in relation to SCP-0002.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Description:</div>
            <p>SCP-0002 refers to the unexplained disappearance of individual socks during normal household laundering processes. The phenomenon occurs globally and has been documented across all cultures that use paired footwear and mechanical washing devices.</p>
            
            <p>The anomaly manifests specifically as the disappearance of one sock from a matching pair, with no pattern to brand, material, size, or color. Extensive investigation has yielded no recoverable physical evidence of the missing items. Video monitoring of washing machines during operation has revealed no visible mechanism of disappearance - the socks simply cease to exist between being placed in the machine and the conclusion of the washing cycle.</p>
            
            <p>The Foundation became aware of SCP-0002 in 1953 when statistical analysis of household item insurance claims revealed a pattern of sock disappearances that could not be explained by conventional means. Initial investigation focused on a single neighborhood in <span class="redacted">█████████</span>, Ohio, but subsequent research confirmed the global nature of the phenomenon. The universality of "missing sock" experiences in human culture suggests the phenomenon has existed since the widespread adoption of washing machines in the early 20th century. The Foundation classifies public awareness of SCP-0002 as "self-normalizing" - the experience is so common that no additional cover story is required.</p>
            
            <p>Of note is that the phenomenon appears limited to residential settings. Commercial laundry facilities report statistically normal rates of missing items attributable to human error or mechanical causes.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Disappearance Patterns:</div>
            <p>Statistical analysis conducted between 1975-2024 has established clear patterns in SCP-0002 manifestations. When a washing load includes an odd number of socks, or a mismatched pair, there is a 17–39% probability that one sock will irreversibly vanish during the wash cycle. The probability increases under the following conditions:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The cycle is set to "delicate" or "quick wash."</li>
                <li>The socks are black, grey, or navy blue.</li>
                <li>The socks are of sentimental or monetary value to the owner (determined post-facto via psychoanalytic screening).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Additionally, manifestations occur more frequently in households with children under the age of twelve (12) and in residential buildings older than fifty (50) years. Seasonal fluctuations have been noted, with peak disappearance rates occurring during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and summer months in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Testing Log 0002-A: Summary of Notable Experiments</div>
                
                <p><strong>Test 0002-01:</strong> Standard observation<br>
                <em>Procedure:</em> 100 pairs of identical white cotton socks were processed through 20 different residential washing machines under direct video surveillance.<br>
                <em>Results:</em> 37 individual socks disappeared. No visible mechanism of disappearance was observed. Socks simply ceased to exist between one frame of video and the next.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Test 0002-14:</strong> Tracer experiment<br>
                <em>Procedure:</em> Socks embedded with radioactive tracers were processed through affected washing machines.<br>
                <em>Results:</em> Upon disappearance, no residual radiation was detected in the machine, surrounding environment, or municipal water systems. Radiation monitoring stations worldwide reported no anomalous readings.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Test 0002-29:</strong> Molecular tracking<br>
                <em>Procedure:</em> High-resolution instrumentation was used to track RFID-tagged socks during washing cycles.<br>
                <em>Results:</em> Data confirmed spatial disassociation at the molecular level sometime during the washing. The location of the missing matter post-disappearance remains unknown.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Test 0002-53:</strong> Machine disassembly<br>
                <em>Procedure:</em> Disassembly of 75 affected machines over a 30-year period.<br>
                <em>Results:</em> No evidence of mechanical failure, blockage, or trace fabric. Lost socks do not accumulate in machine components, sewage systems, or Foundation-controlled landfill sites.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Test 0002-88:</strong> Dimensional barrier testing<br>
                <em>Procedure:</em> Various dimensional stabilization fields were established around washing machines during operation.<br>
                <em>Results:</em> No change in disappearance rates observed, regardless of field strength or type.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Proposed Theories</div>
                
                <p><strong>Proposed Theory A:</strong> The missing socks exist in a currently undetectable state or dimension.</p>
                
                <p>Proponents of Theory A suggest that the washing machine spin cycle temporarily creates micro-rifts in spacetime, through which small fabric items can be transported. Attempts to measure energy fluctuations or dimensional instabilities during washing cycles have yielded inconclusive results. The dimensional displacement theory remains unproven but is considered plausible by several senior researchers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Proposed Theory B:</strong> The phenomenon represents a minor reality fluctuation tied to probability.</p>
                
                <p>This theory posits that SCP-0002 may be a manifestation of quantum uncertainty at the macroscopic level, with socks occasionally "deciding" to exist elsewhere when unobserved. Testing protocols involving continuous observation of laundry loads have shown inconsistent results, with disappearances still occurring despite monitoring.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Proposed Theory C:</strong> The disappearances are a manifestation of an unknown natural law regarding paired objects.</p>
                
                <p>Theory C suggests that there exists an undiscovered natural law that governs paired items, particularly those in close association with human daily life. This theory is supported by similar phenomena noted with gloves, earrings, and other paired objects, though none occur at the statistical frequency of sock disappearances.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Incident Report 0002-Alpha:</div>
                
                <p>On 03/14/2019, Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span>, a Foundation researcher previously assigned to SCP-<span class="redacted">████</span> (a cognitohazardous entity), began making unusual claims regarding SCP-0002. Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> had no prior connection to SCP-0002 research but requested immediate reassignment to the project following what colleagues described as "several sleepless nights."</p>
                
                <p>During the subsequent psychiatric evaluation, Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> became agitated and was recorded stating: "I don't care if this is a 'low-threat anomaly.' Something is wearing the socks."</p>
                
                <p>Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> was placed on administrative leave and treated for possible cognitohazardous contamination. After four weeks of therapy and amnestic treatment, Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> returned to duty with no recollection of the incident. No evidence supporting the researcher's claims has been found, and the incident has been classified as a case of cross-contamination from previous research subjects.</p>
                
                <p>As a precautionary measure, all personnel previously exposed to SCP-<span class="redacted">████</span> are now excluded from SCP-0002 research.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 0002-1:</div>
                
                <p>Research is ongoing, but no imminently dangerous properties have been detected in over seven decades of observation. The loss of the items appears to be permanent, with no recorded instances of spontaneous reappearance after documented disappearance.</p>
