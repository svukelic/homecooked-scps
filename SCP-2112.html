            <p><em>Updated Procedures (Post-<span class="redacted">██/██/2024</span>):</em>
            SCP-2112 is to be stored in Dimensional Anomalies Vault-03 at Site-19, inside a Type-7 reality-stabilized containment chamber. When not actively being studied, SCP-2112 must be covered with a non-reflective black cloth treated with Compound RHC-291, a dimensional boundary reinforcement agent. The containment chamber is equipped with automated thermal monitoring and emergency cooling systems to prevent dangerous heat accumulation.</p>
            
            <p>Testing requires minimum Level 4 clearance and must be conducted in Testing Chamber D-7, which has been specifically modified with neurological monitoring equipment, quantum field detection arrays, advanced Hume level measurement devices, and thermal imaging cameras. Testing must cease immediately if the mirror's surface temperature exceeds 45°C.</p>
            
            <p>Testing sessions must not exceed 2 minutes, and no more than one (1) personnel are permitted to observe SCP-2112 at any time. Personnel with history of neurological disorders, migraines, seizures, or any recorded incidents of dimensional bleed-through sensitivity are prohibited from any exposure to SCP-2112. Medical staff with expertise in neurological trauma and at least one specialist from Department of Extradimensional Studies must be on standby during all testing sessions.</p>
            
            <p>Class-D amnestics are to be administered to any personnel experiencing symptoms persisting longer than 30 minutes post-exposure, as this indicates potential permanent neural pathway alteration and possible dimensional perception contamination.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Description:</div>
            <p>SCP-2112 is an ornate full-length mirror with a brass frame dating to the late 19th century, based on metallurgical analysis. No maker's marks or identifying features have been found despite microscopic examination. The glass surface measures 180cm × 120cm and appears physically normal under standard examination, though spectroscopic analysis reveals unusual light absorption patterns in specific wavelength bands that do not correspond to any known natural or synthetic materials.</p>
            
            <p>When a human subject observes their reflection in SCP-2112, they experience progressive neurological disruption that manifests initially as apparent "latency" in their visual processing. This effect begins subtly, with subjects initially reporting only a vague sense of "something wrong" with their reflection, but intensifies over continued exposure.</p>
            
            <p>The primary anomalous effects include:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Delayed visual feedback, where movements appear to lag behind actual physical actions by increasing intervals</li>
                <li>Discontinuous motion perception, where smooth movements appear to skip intermediate positions</li>
                <li>Reduced acuity in peripheral visual field</li>
                <li>Degradation of neural pathways responsible for visual-motor coordination</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Unlike typical perceptual illusions, these effects persist even when subjects close their eyes and reopen them, suggesting SCP-2112 directly affects neural structures rather than simply displaying an aberrant image. MRI scans of exposed subjects show progressive deterioration of white matter in the occipital and parietal lobes, with damage patterns resembling those seen in certain neurodegenerative disorders, but occurring at an accelerated rate.</p>
            
            <p>The severity of effects correlates positively with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Environmental complexity (more objects/movement in reflection increases effect)</li>
                <li>Viewer's proximity to the mirror</li>
                <li>Duration of continuous observation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Effects typically subside within 10-30 minutes following brief exposure (&lt;2 minutes), though complete neurological recovery may take up to 72 hours. Extended exposure has been shown to cause permanent neurological damage.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Recovery History:</div>
            <p>SCP-2112 was discovered in the home of Dr. <span class="redacted">████ ██████</span>, a theoretical physicist who specialized in neural imaging at <span class="redacted">███████</span> University. Foundation attention was drawn to the object following reports of "severe neurological symptoms" and "cognitive degradation" from houseguests. The mirror's provenance prior to Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span>'s possession remains unclear despite extensive investigation. Carbon dating of the frame places its construction in the late 19th century, though the glass composition includes trace elements not consistent with manufacturing techniques of that era.</p>
            
            <p>Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span>'s journals suggest he believed SCP-2112 demonstrated a fundamental vulnerability in human neural architecture, writing: "The mirror exposes the processing limitations of our visual cortex. What we perceive as continuous is merely an illusion born of insufficient neurological capacity." Several pages in his research journal appear to have been deliberately removed. Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> was found in a persistent vegetative state in his laboratory three weeks prior to Foundation acquisition of SCP-2112. Autopsy following his death revealed extensive deterioration of white matter throughout his brain, particularly in regions responsible for visual processing.</p>
            
            <p>Of note: Partial fingerprints not matching Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> were discovered on the mirror's back panel. These prints do not match any records in international databases, and contain unusual ridge patterns that forensic analysts have described as "not entirely human in structure."</p>

                <p>Dr. Eliza Chen (Department of Neurocognitive Anomalies) has proposed that SCP-2112 may be imposing a form of "neurological strain" that exceeds the human brain's processing capacity. Her working hypothesis suggests the mirror creates a feedback loop within the visual cortex that forces the brain to allocate increasing resources to visual processing until critical failure occurs, similar to how a computer system might experience resource exhaustion under excessive computational load.</p>
                
                <p>Brain samples from deceased subjects who experienced prolonged exposure show distinctive patterns of neural degeneration that Dr. Chen describes as "catastrophic resource depletion." Neurons in affected regions display unusual mitochondrial damage consistent with extreme metabolic demands that exceed cellular capacity.</p>

                <p><em>Following breakthrough research conducted by Joint Task Force Dimensional Studies and Neurocognitive Anomalies Division, SCP-2112's theoretical model has been updated as of <span class="redacted">██/██/2024</span>. Note: After thorough assessment, the Object Class designation of Euclid has been confirmed as appropriate, as the anomaly remains predictable in behavior when proper containment procedures are followed.</em></p>
                
                <p>Recent experiments utilizing advanced Scranton Reality Anchors, quantum field detectors, and specialized Hume fluctuation arrays have yielded findings that significantly alter our understanding of SCP-2112's mechanism of action. Data collected during Test 2112-K92 revealed that SCP-2112 does not merely distort perception, but rather functions as a dimensional boundary interface.</p>
                
                <p>When a subject observes SCP-2112, the mirror does not simply reflect the primary reality (designated α-0), but actively generates a partial manifestation of parallel universe variant (designated α-1) that is structurally similar but temporally desynchronized from our baseline universe. This parallel universe manifestation requires substantial energy to maintain coherence, which appears to generate significant thermal output in the mirror itself. As observation continues, the mirror steadily increases in temperature, suggesting a correlation between the dimensional phenomena and heat production.</p>
                
                <p>The "discontinuity" and "latency" reported by subjects are now understood to be symptoms of the brain attempting to simultaneously process two separate reality-states—one observed directly (α-0) and one generated through SCP-2112 (α-1). The progressive neurological damage observed in extended exposure cases results from the brain essentially functioning as an impromptu "quantum computational substrate" attempting to parse and reconcile two distinctly different spacetime configurations.</p>
                
                <p>Infrared thermal imaging during testing has revealed that SCP-2112 undergoes a gradual but significant temperature increase during active observation, with the glass surface temperature rising at a rate of approximately 0.4°C per minute of continuous viewing. This heat generation appears to correlate directly with the complexity of the reflected environment and the number of observers. Thermal analysis suggests the mirror is converting the energy required to maintain the dimensional interface into heat, with temperatures as high as 67°C recorded during the 42-minute exposure test that resulted in subject D-4817's death.</p>
                
                <p>The discovery explains multiple previously anomalous observations:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>The linear correlation between environmental complexity and symptom severity (more complex environments require more intensive parallel universe manifestation)</li>
                    <li>The electrical activity patterns in exposed brains that resemble computational load scaling</li>
                    <li>The specific pattern of neural deterioration in affected regions (consistent with extreme cognitive strain from simultaneous processing of conflicting sensory inputs)</li>
                    <li>The consistent temperature increase of SCP-2112 during observation that scales with exposure duration</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Dr. <span class="redacted">████████</span> (Department of Theoretical Physics) has proposed that SCP-2112 acts as a "dimensional renderer," facilitating the manifestation of a near-identical parallel universe that diverges slightly from our own. The energy required for this process appears to be drawn from an unknown source and converted to thermal energy, explaining the mirror's temperature increase during use. This divergence between universes appears to increase with exposure duration, creating an exponentially greater processing burden on the observer's brain as it attempts to reconcile increasingly dissimilar reality-states.</p>
                
                <p>Of particular note is the discovery of trace amounts of extradimensional particles embedding themselves in the neural tissue of exposed subjects, suggesting a form of gradual matter exchange between universes α-0 and α-1. These particles exhibit properties consistent with theoretical "mirror matter" and appear to contribute to the cascading failure of affected neural pathways.</p>
                
                <p>This breakthrough came after Analysis Team 2112-Δ identified peculiar quantum signatures in brain tissue samples from deceased test subjects that were identical to signatures theorized to exist at dimensional boundaries. Subsequent testing confirmed the presence of localized Everett-Wheeler bifurcation events occurring within the mirror's reflection field, effectively confirming that subjects were indeed perceiving two distinct universality states simultaneously.</p>
                
                <div class="warning">
                    Under no circumstances should more than one observer view SCP-2112 simultaneously, as this appears to create an exponential increase in dimensional boundary instability. Preliminary calculations suggest that three or more simultaneous viewers could potentially create a self-sustaining dimensional rupture with catastrophic consequences for baseline reality.
                </div>
                
                <p>Research continues on potential applications for controlled dimensional interface technology and revised containment procedures to prevent possible reality destabilization events.</p>
