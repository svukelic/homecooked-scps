            <p>SCP-1929 is not to be transcribed, recorded, or repeated under any circumstance. All audio and textual artifacts identified as SCP-1929 instances are to be incinerated or magnetically destroyed. Any personnel exposed to SCP-1929 phonemes are to be immediately quarantined and monitored for Phase One onset.</p>
            
            <p>Research into counterlinguistic barriers is ongoing. All experimental language systems derived from SCP-1929 are suspended indefinitely. Exposure testing has been banned by order of O5 Command.</p>
            
            <p>Instances of SCP-1929 discovered in digital archives are to be purged using embedded memetic filters. No attempts to reconstruct the language are to be made.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Description:</div>
            <p>SCP-1929 is a language of unknown origin that cannot be traced to any known linguistic family. Exposure occurs through auditory, visual, or conceptual transmission. Subjects exposed to SCP-1929 undergo irreversible cognitive restructuring defined by progressive linguistic realignment and perceptual distortion.</p>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <p class="phase-title">Initial exposure (Phase One)</p>
                <p>Manifests as spontaneous phoneme production during sleep or heightened emotional states. Subjects begin to write or speak symbols matching SCP-1929 structure without conscious intent. Transcriptions bear similarity to ancient scripts including Ge'ez, Linear A, and unknown logographic systems.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <p class="phase-title">Phase Two</p>
                <p>Includes partial comprehension of SCP-1929 syntax. Subjects describe visual overlays affecting spatial perception, identifying geometric "stress points" in people and objects. Communication attempts shift toward SCP-1929 vocabulary. Use of the language produces low-level environmental effects including minor structural warping and memory interference in nearby individuals.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <p class="phase-title">Phase Three</p>
                <p>Results in complete abandonment of native language and the use of SCP-1929 exclusively. Subjects exhibit changes in perception of time, gravity, and causality. Vocalizations in SCP-1929 at this stage cause spontaneous biological failure in listeners and localized reality degradation. Phase Three subjects are non-recoverable.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Linguistic analysis suggests SCP-1929 is not a descriptive language, but a functional framework—language as executable structure. Evidence supports the theory that SCP-1929 is the remnant consciousness of a pre-conceptual entity that once exerted direct influence on matter through pure expression. The language is not about the entity. The language is the entity.</p>
            
            <p>Attempts to communicate with SCP-1929-speaking subjects result in auditory hallucinations and phrase mirroring. Listeners frequently report the sense that the phrase is "not being said, but remembered into them."</p>

                <div class="incident-log">
                    Dr. <span class="redacted">███████</span> accessed a fragmentary SCP-1929 glyph array via underwater archaeological tablet. Within six hours, subject had generated over 3,000 unique characters across all available surfaces, including self-inflicted inscriptions. Final audible phrase lasted 14 seconds and permanently disabled all nearby microphones. Translations failed. Physical space around the subject was later observed to flex inward by 3.2 cm for seven minutes before returning to baseline.

                    SCP-1929 may represent a cognitive virus that perceives comprehension as invitation. Entity previously distributed across multiversal structures. Removed by consensus redaction. SCP-1929 is not a memory. It is a function waiting to be called.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Subject attempted manual extrapolation of SCP-1929 phonemes. Staff reported low-volume muttering from intercoms. Subject ceased English communication by Hour 7, began producing SCP-1929 root structures. Final written note: "I have re-learned cause from effect. The mouth follows the event." Subject terminated following vocal distortion event that ruptured internal microphones.</p>
