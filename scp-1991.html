                <li>Foundation front organizations are to maintain cultural anthropology research centers in all Zone-Mosaic territories.</li>
                <li>Foundation personnel embedded in media organizations are to promote narratives attributing SCP-1991-A manifestations to "colorful cultural traditions" and "regional temperament."</li>
                <li>Zone-Mosaic borders are to be monitored for instances of SCP-1991 expansion.</li>
                <li>SCP-1991-A instances who relocate outside Zone-Mosaic are to be monitored but not detained unless exhibiting Category 3 or higher manifestations.</li>

            <div class="section-title">Description:</div>
            <p>SCP-1991 is a complex anomalous phenomenon affecting approximately 50 million individuals across a geographically contiguous region. Affected individuals are collectively designated as SCP-1991-A instances.</p>
            
            <p>SCP-1991-A instances demonstrate consistent behavioral, cognitive, and physical anomalies that appear to be transmissible through both prolonged exposure and heredity. Current research suggests the anomaly has existed for at least 1,500 years, with historical records indicating consistent manifestation patterns despite significant geopolitical changes.</p>
            
            <p>Primary manifestations of SCP-1991-A instances include but are not limited to:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linguistic Anomaly:</strong> SCP-1991-A instances can understand each other at an approximate 65-80% comprehension rate despite speaking what linguistics experts classify as distinct languages. This mutual comprehension increases to 95-100% when discussing food, expressing frustration, or engaging in good-natured insults. When questioned, subjects will vehemently deny this ability while simultaneously demonstrating it.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Spatial-Temporal Distortion:</strong> Small gatherings (3-5 individuals) of SCP-1991-A instances will, with statistical improbability, transform into large celebrations (20+ individuals) within 2-3 hours. This is accompanied by the manifestation of elaborate food spreads that exceed the logically available resources. Analysis of video footage shows no clear moment of transition; the expansion appears to occur during brief camera cuts or moments of inattention by observers.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Memetic Resistance/Susceptibility Complex:</strong> SCP-1991-A instances display immunity to certain memetic and cognitohazardous effects, particularly those related to cultural homogenization. However, they simultaneously demonstrate extreme susceptibility to regional identity-based narratives and historical events, some dating back several centuries, which continue to trigger strong emotional responses despite temporal distance.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Competitive Hospitality Syndrome:</strong> When in the presence of guests, SCP-1991-A instances enter a state of compulsive generosity that can reach economically self-destructive levels. Attempts to refuse offered food or drink trigger distress responses in the host. In experimental settings, SCP-1991-A instances were capable of producing up to seven consecutive "final offerings" of food despite claiming each was absolutely the last.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Acoustic Anomaly:</strong> Music produced by SCP-1991-A instances, particularly using instruments designated as "traditional," has been observed to induce emotional states in listeners not consistent with the technical qualities of the music. Specific rhythmic patterns classified as "irregular" (typically in 7/8, 9/8, and 11/8 time signatures) trigger involuntary foot-tapping and hip movements in 85% of exposed subjects, regardless of cultural background.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Historical Hypermnesia:</strong> SCP-1991-A instances can recall with perfect clarity complex historical narratives dating back several centuries, despite demonstrating average or below-average memory function in controlled testing for non-regional information. These historical narratives often conflict between different affected groups but are maintained with unwavering certainty.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Gesture-Enhanced Communication:</strong> SCP-1991-A instances utilize hand gestures at a rate 300% higher than baseline human populations. Removal of the ability to gesture (through restraint or injury) reduces communication efficiency by approximately 72% and induces significant distress.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 1991-1: Notable Incidents</div>
                
                <p><strong>Incident 1991-A:</strong> During a Foundation-monitored cultural festival in Zone-Mosaic, three distinct groups of SCP-1991-A instances engaged in a heated debate regarding the proper preparation of a specific food item. Monitoring equipment recorded ambient temperature increases of 4.7°C in the immediate vicinity despite no additional heat sources. The debate concluded with all parties declaring victory simultaneously, followed by communal consumption of all disputed food items.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Incident 1991-B:</strong> Foundation researcher Dr. <span class="redacted">███████</span> assigned to SCP-1991 for 3+ years began exhibiting SCP-1991-A manifestations despite no genetic connection to the region. Subject developed strong opinions about regional coffee preparation methods and began ending sentences with specific regional linguistic particles. Subject has been reassigned to non-contact research positions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Incident 1991-C:</strong> A community of approximately 230 SCP-1991-A instances relocated to <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>, Australia, in the 1960s. Satellite imagery from 1975-present confirms the gradual transformation of the surrounding landscape to match Zone-Mosaic topography within a 3km radius, including the emergence of architectural features not constructed by conventional means. Local residents report perceiving the area as "always having been that way."</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Exposure therapy using mainstream Western pop music has proven ineffective in reducing symptoms. SCP-1991-A instances either develop immediate distaste for the music or begin performing it with irregular rhythmic patterns and added vocal embellishments.</li>
                    
                    <li>Attempts to introduce standardized fast-food chains within Zone-Mosaic have consistently failed despite market research indicating viability. Businesses report inexplicable equipment failures specifically affecting standardization processes.</li>
                    
                    <li>Foundation researchers have noted that SCP-1991-A manifestations intensify during specific calendar periods, most notably during the summer months and between December 31st and January 14th, when temporal anomalies have been observed with SCP-1991-A instances appearing to celebrate New Year's twice.</li>

                <p>The Ethics Committee has determined that full containment of SCP-1991 would be both impractical and unnecessary as the anomaly appears stable and presents minimal risk to normalcy preservation efforts outside Zone-Mosaic. Current containment strategy focuses on monitoring for potential escalation of anomalous effects.</p>
                
                <p>Dr. <span class="redacted">██████████</span> has proposed classifying SCP-1991 as a potential Thaumiel-class asset, noting that affected communities have historically served as effective buffers against other anomalous threats attempting to enter <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> from <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>. This proposal remains under review.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 1991-5: Historical Neutralization Attempt</div>
                
                <div class="clearance-box">LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED</div>
                
                <p>Mobile Task Force Eta-11 ("Tessellators") recovered documents indicating that <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> attempted neutralization of SCP-1991 through coordinated <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> operations during the 19<span class="redacted">██</span> period. Document <span class="redacted">███-1991-██</span> outlines that <span class="redacted">███████ ███████</span> with connections to <span class="redacted">[DATA EXPUNGED]</span> orchestrated multiple <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> across the Zone-Mosaic region as part of Project <span class="redacted">███████-DISINTEGRATION</span>.</p>
                
                <p>Foundation assets embedded within <span class="redacted">████ ███████</span> Intelligence intercepted communications suggesting multiple external actors collaborated on the operation despite <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> public appearances. Analysis of these events by Foundation historians suggests that the operation was intended to <span class="redacted">████████ ████████</span> the SCP-1991-A population through artificial <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> and strategic exploitation of SCP-1991-A's susceptibility to <span class="redacted">████████ ██████</span> narratives.</p>
                
                <p>Task Force Eta-11 reported that anomalous energy readings in Zone-Mosaic increased by <span class="redacted">███%</span> during the neutralization attempt. Field Agent <span class="redacted">████████</span> documented instances of SCP-1991-A manifestations becoming significantly more pronounced in areas with highest <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> activity, particularly the "Competitive Hospitality Syndrome" and "Historical Hypermnesia" effects.</p>
                
                <p>The neutralization attempt failed due to <span class="redacted">███████ ███████ ████████</span> and unintentionally strengthened certain SCP-1991-A manifestations by approximately <span class="redacted">██%</span>. Surviving documents indicate that <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> considered the neutralization attempt "successful" despite all evidence to the contrary. Five members of Task Force Eta-11 were lost during the final phase of <span class="redacted">████████</span>. Agents were caught in crossfire while monitoring escalations between SCP-1991-A groups near <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>. Official mission logs indicate their presence was detected after Agent <span class="redacted">███████</span> attempted to mediate a <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> dispute, triggering rapid hostility from multiple factions.</p>
                
                <p>O5-<span class="redacted">█</span> has authorized limited <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> to prevent similar neutralization attempts, as computer modeling suggests a second attempt could result in a containment breach and regional destabilization.</p>
                
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> All personnel involved in researching this incident must undergo psychological evaluation before and after accessing full documentation. Personnel exhibiting symptoms consistent with SCP-1991-A manifestations following document review are to be quarantined and assessed for memetic contamination.</p>
