            <p>SCP-1870 is to be kept in Break Room C-7 at Site-19. Personnel are permitted to use the item for food storage and preparation under the following conditions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A log must be maintained of all items placed in SCP-1870 and their respective durations.</li>
                <li>The device must not be left running on Setting I ("Refresh-A-Tron") for more than 72 consecutive hours without supervision.</li>
                <li>Items aged via Setting II ("Speed-O-Matic Zip-Zap!") must be inspected by on-site biohazard personnel before consumption.</li>
                <li>No living organisms are to be placed inside SCP-1870.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="section-title">Description:</div>
            <p>SCP-1870 appears to be a countertop microwave oven with design elements consistent with kitchen appliances manufactured in the mid-1950s. The device features a rounded, chrome-plated exterior, analog dials, and a modified control panel featuring two unique settings not found on commercial models.</p>
            
            <p>Setting I, labeled "Refresh-A-Tron," causes any organic matter placed within the microwave to remain in its current state of freshness for the duration of operation. Temporal analysis suggests the device creates a localized chrono-static field where degradation processes appear to be counterbalanced at a 1:1 ratio with real-time progression. When the device is stopped, normal temporal progression resumes.</p>
            
            <p>Setting II, labeled "Speed-O-Matic Zip-Zap!" causes any organic matter placed within the microwave to age rapidly, advancing approximately 5.4 months per second, which accumulates to 27 years for each minute of operation. Items subjected to this setting undergo all natural processes of aging, fermentation, decomposition, or maturation that would occur over the equivalent time period under optimal conditions.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Incident 1870-A:</div>
            <p>On <span class="redacted">██/██/19██</span>, Researcher Dawkins attempted to use both settings simultaneously by setting the timer for 3 and half minutes and manipulating the control panel. This resulted in the microwave emitting a low-frequency hum, after which all flat surfaces within a 30-meter radius (tables, desks, computer monitors, picture frames, etc.) began rotating clockwise at approximately 6 RPM along their center axes parallel to the plane of each surface, regardless of size or weight. The rotation effect persisted for exactly 3 and half minutes despite SCP-1870 being disconnected from power. Three personnel reported experiencing moments of déjà vu lasting up to 2 weeks. Researcher Dawkins was found to have developed a strange condition where his digestive system began processing food in reverse - nutrition was extracted normally, but waste matter would transform back into undigested food which he would regurgitate in a pristine, ready-to-eat state. This condition persisted for 19 days before spontaneously resolving. Dual operation is now explicitly forbidden.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Incident 1870-B:</div>
            <p>On <span class="redacted">██/██/20██</span>, a power surge during routine testing caused SCP-1870 to activate without any settings selected. Junior Researcher Vasquez, who was observing the test, reported that for approximately 3.5 seconds, she could see what appeared to be "every meal that had ever been or would ever be placed in the microwave." Following the incident, Vasquez was able to accurately predict which foods would be placed in SCP-1870 for the next two weeks. This precognitive ability faded gradually and was entirely absent by the 15th day post-incident.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fresh milk subjected to Setting II for 1 minute transformed into perfectly aged cheese with characteristics consistent with 27-year maturation.</li>
                    <li>A McDonald's hamburger placed on Setting I has remained in stasis for <span class="redacted">██</span> months with no signs of degradation.</li>
                    <li>A bottle of inexpensive wine exposed to Setting II for 4 minutes (equivalent to 108 years of aging) resulted in a vintage described by Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> as "transcendent" and "impossible to achieve through conventional means."</li>
                    <li>A partially eaten yogurt container forgotten in SCP-1870 while operating on Setting I for 17 days was discovered in the exact same state of freshness as when initially placed.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 1870-2: Recovery Note</div>
                <p>SCP-1870 was discovered in the basement of a decommissioned military housing complex approximately 70 km from a series of 1950s nuclear test sites. Documentation found with the device included a partially burned manufacturer's manual with the heading "ATOMIK KITCHEN MARVELS FOR THE MODERN HOME" and a handwritten note reading "Time flows differently in the radiation zone. The boys from Washington say it's nothing to worry about." The previous owner, retired Army Colonel <span class="redacted">████████</span>, claimed the device "came from the future that never happened" and that it "worked better during atmospheric testing days."</p>
