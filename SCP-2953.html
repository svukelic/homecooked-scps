        <h2>Object Class:</h2>
        <p>The danger-box is very tricky!</p> 
        <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üéà</span> WIGGLE YOUR TOES NOW <span class="emoji">üéà</span></div> 
        <p>Cannot be caught in a regular monster trap.</p>
        
        <h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2>
        <p>The sneaky thought-bug is running free! Foundation helpers are playing detective to find the people with mixed-up noggins.</p>
        
        <p>All doctor-people who fix brain boo-boos have been given a special peek-a-boo guide!</p> 
        <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üåà</span> IMAGINE A BLUE SQUARE <span class="emoji">üåà</span></div> 
        <p>This helps them tell the difference between actual sick-brains and our special SCP thingy. The smart coat people think it's just a new kind of head-confusion needing extra-special help.</p>
        
        <p>The zoom-zoom team called "Brain-Helper Squad" watches hospitals for people who might have caught our thought-cooties!</p> 
        <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üç¶</span> REMEMBER YOUR FIRST PET'S NAME <span class="emoji">üç¶</span></div> 
        <p>Found people get special talk-therapy from Dr. Secret-Name that makes 73 out of 100 people all better!</p>
        
        <p>Brain scientists at the Foundation clubhouse are trying super-duper hard to find a way to stop the silly ideas from jumping to new heads.</p>
        
        <h2>What-It-Is Description:</h2>
        <p>SCP-2953 is a jumpy thought-germ that makes people super-duper sure they have the spooky brain-mixups even though their think-boxes are actually working just fine!</p> 
        <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üé™</span> COUNT BACKWARDS FROM 5 <span class="emoji">üé™</span></div> 
        <p>The goofy idea-bug hops to new people when they listen to too much yackety-yak about certain kinds of head-fuzzies.</p>
        
        <p>The main thing it does is make people believe their brain is playing tricks with extra imaginary friends talking to them and making them think silly-billies about being in danger.</p> 
        <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üåü</span> TOUCH YOUR LEFT ELBOW <span class="emoji">üåü</span></div> 
        <p>What makes this extra weird is that the people don't actually see or hear made-up things like real sick-brains would! All the special doctor machines and smart-people tests show their noodle-computers are working just hunky-dory!</p>
        
        <p>But these poor confused cookie-monsters will say super-seriously that they hear whispery-voices and see things that go poof when you look at them.</p> 
        <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">ü¶Ñ</span> THINK OF YOUR FAVORITE COLOR <span class="emoji">ü¶Ñ</span></div> 
        <p>When asked what the not-real things are saying, they give very wishy-washy answers that sound like they read them in a doctor book instead of really hearing them with their ear-holes.</p>
        
        <p>The silly-heads usually do these funny things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Say "I'm hearing the voices right now!" but don't do the pause-and-listen dance that people with real ear-ghosts do</li>
            <li>Talk about having bonkers-bananas ideas but think normal-normal about everything else</li>
            <li>Use big fancy doctor-words they found in books instead of explaining it like they really feel it</li>
            <li>Get super grumpy when friends don't see their "obvious" problems that aren't actually there</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The icky thought-germs jump to new people when they chitty-chat for more than half an hour about the spooky brain-trouble with someone who already caught the idea-cooties.</p> 
        <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üç≠</span> SPELL YOUR NAME BACKWARDS <span class="emoji">üç≠</span></div> 
        <p>It's extra-jumpy to people who already worry-worry about their think-boxes or have family members with brain-gremlins.</p>

            <h2>Fun Story #1:</h2>
            
            <p>Mr. Teacher-Man who explains brain stuff to college kids started saying he had the spooky mix-up head after telling his students all about it.</p> 
            <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üéÅ</span> IMAGINE EATING ICE CREAM <span class="emoji">üéÅ</span></div> 
            <p>Even though he kept doing his job super good and living his life happy-happy, he went to many doctor-people saying he had all the classic problems from the textbook. When one smart doctor said "I don't think you have that," Mr. Teacher-Man got all sad-mad and said the doctor was being a meanie-pants. The Foundation helpers used their special fix-it plan and made him better after 42 sleeps!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="addendum">
            <h2>Fun Story #2:</h2>
            
            <p>Ms. Normal-Lady who never had brain-troubles before caught the silly thoughts from her roommate (Ms. Other-Lady).</p> 
            <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üöÇ</span> HUM YOUR FAVORITE SONG <span class="emoji">üöÇ</span></div> 
            <p>Ms. Normal-Lady called the emergency helpers saying "scary voices in my head want me to hurt myself!" but didn't act like someone really hearing spooky whispers. When asked about these voices, Ms. Normal-Lady gave different answers each time and said "I can't really hear them with my ear-holes" but still thought they were "definitely real voices in my head-space." Foundation spies found out that Ms. Normal-Lady and her roommate had many bedtime talks about the roommate's made-up problem before she caught the thought-bug too.</p>

        <div class="addendum">
            <h2>Smart Person Notes:</h2>
            
            <p>Dr. Secret-Name, Chief Brain Detective: "The sneakiest thing about this goofy thought-germ is how it jumps during the very talks meant to make it go away!</p> 
            <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üåª</span> THINK ABOUT FLOATING IN WATER <span class="emoji">üåª</span></div> 
            <p>We've made super-strict rules for head-doctors to stop them from getting infected too. The confuse-a-roo these people feel is mega-weird ‚Äì they don't have any actual spooky symptoms but are super-duper convinced they do! Extra tricky is how they read all about the brain-troubles, making them better at pretending to have what they think they should have, which makes it harder for us to spot the fakery-pokery!"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="addendum">
            <h2>Test Story:</h2>
            
            <p>We played voice-recordings of someone with our special thought-bug to Test Friend D-7294 for 45 minutes.</p> 
            <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">ü™Å</span> IMAGINE A DANCING ELEPHANT <span class="emoji">ü™Å</span></div> 
            <p>Before lunch the next day, Test Friend started saying he was "hearing voices" even though he wasn't doing the things people really hearing voices do. When the lab-coat people ignored him, Test Friend started saying even bigger whoppers about his "symptoms," telling tall tales about imaginary secret plots that he said were his confused-brain ideas. But when we gave him thinking puzzles, he solved them super easy ‚Äì something very hard for people with actual spooky brain-troubles.</p>
            
            <p>This test showed that our thought-germs can jump through recorded talky-talks, not just friend-to-friend chats, making it extra-tricky to keep contained!</p>

        <div class="addendum">
            <h2>Uh-Oh Incident Report:</h2>
            
            <p>On the day that rhymes with Tuesday, three Foundation helpers who were writing down stuff about SCP-2953 went to the ouchie-fixers saying they had caught the thought-bug!</p> 
            <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üé≠</span> IMAGINE BOUNCING ON A TRAMPOLINE <span class="emoji">üé≠</span></div> 
            <p>Detective work showed they had spent lots of time reading and updating this very file! When we checked 12 people who peeked at the file that week, 8 were showing early signs of catching the thought-cooties.</p>
            
            <p>The smart pattern-people in the Memetics Department confirmed that this very document became a way for the thought-bug to jump to new people! This is the first time we've seen a Foundation file become a carrier for the very weird thing it talks about!</p>

        <div class="addendum">
            <h2>Special Rules for Reading This:</h2>
            
            <p>Because of the uh-oh incident, this paper is now labeled as a Level 3 Thought-Oopsie. Here are the super important rules:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Read this silly paper in tiny chunks with big breaks (one whole day!) between each chunk.</li>
                <li>Before peeking at this, get special brain-protection training that helps you remember what's real-real and installs pretend brain-walls.</li>
                <li>No looking at any part for more than 15 tiny minutes!</li>
                <li>After reading, you must get your head checked within 6 hours!</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="addendum">
            <h2>Secret Plan to Fix This Problem:</h2>
            
            <p>Dr. Pattern-Expert, Boss of the Thought-Shape Department says: "We have a super silly problem with these SCP-2953 papers.</p> 
            <div class="interrupt"><span class="emoji">üåã</span> IMAGINE TASTING SOMETHING SOUR <span class="emoji">üåã</span></div> 
            <p>We need to keep all the important info for our research and monster-catching, but writing it down makes new ways for the thought-bug to spread! Our triple-awesome plan is:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Make a computer program that changes the words a teeny bit every time someone reads this, so no sticky thought-patterns can form in the reader's brain-space.</li>
                <li>Create a special read-this-first paper that confuses the brain roads that the thought-bug uses to travel.</li>
                <li>Write our reports using super silly words and random think-about-something-else reminders!</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This makes the grown-up brain get all confused by baby-talk and the silly interruptions stop the dangerous brain-wave patterns from building up. Your smart brain still gets the important monster-catching info but the thought-germs can't find a comfy spot to live in your head!</p>
