            <p>No preventative containment measures exist for SCP-1965. Response protocols are focused on post-manifestation stabilization, psychological triage, and memetic damage control.</p>
            
            <p>Civilian reports of persistent dream states involving familial abandonment are to be flagged and cross-referenced with SCP-1965 behavioral indicators. Subjects exhibiting signs of SCP-1965 exposure are to be placed under indefinite psychiatric observation.</p>
            
            <p>Individuals found attempting to locate or reestablish contact with SCP-1965-1 instances are to be detained and administered Class-B amnestics. Ethics Committee authorization for voluntary euthanasia is pre-approved for all Phase Three subjects.</p>
            
            <p>Digital surveillance tools are to monitor for anomalous search terms including "long road dream," "he kept walking," and "they never looked back." Individuals searching these terms repeatedly should be considered potential SCP-1965 vectors.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Description:</div>
            <p>SCP-1965 is a oneiric phenomenon triggered by the completion of a spontaneous sequence of mundane actions. The precise activation sequence varies by individual but typically includes combinations of:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Consuming specific combinations of food within a 12-hour period</li>
                <li>Repeating unconscious movement patterns over multiple days</li>
                <li>Engaging in nostalgia-related rituals involving family or isolation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Following the activation sequence, the subject will experience a recurring dream event referred to as SCP-1965-A. The event consistently involves the subject witnessing a loved one walking away along a long path or road, typically without acknowledgement or response. The dream ends when the figure pauses, looks back briefly, then continues walking. Subjects awaken in a state of acute emotional distress.</p>
            
            <p>Following the SCP-1965-A event, the subject will begin experiencing visual phenomena involving SCP-1965-1â€”an individual the subject believes to be a loved one, typically parental or spousal in nature. SCP-1965-1 will appear in peripheral vision, disappearing upon direct observation. These sightings increase in frequency and proximity over time.</p>
            
            <p>Subsequent investigation reveals that SCP-1965-1 has never existed. Records, photographs, and testimonies from others show no evidence of the individual's reality. Despite this, the subject retains vivid and emotionally intense memories of SCP-1965-1, including fabricated shared experiences.</p>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <p class="phase-title">Phase Two</p>
                <p>Involves progressive breakdown in trust between the subject and their social circle, often accompanied by memory distortion regarding major life events. Subjects begin to reject existing loved ones as impostors and develop fixation on locating or retrieving SCP-1965-1.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phase">
                <p class="phase-title">Phase Three</p>
                <p>Characterized by linguistic drift, emotional flattening, and fatalistic ideation. Subjects often report dreams of walking the road themselves, with SCP-1965-1 always just ahead. Some attempt physical travel, often walking until collapse. Retrieval teams are advised not to interfere unless subject reaches a major roadway or geographic threshold.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 1965-A: Cognitive Note</div>
                
                <p>Multiple subjects have independently described SCP-1965-1 as "someone I was supposed to miss," or "the one they forgot to give me." Emotional response remains consistent even after exposure to contradictory evidence.</p>
                
                <p>SCP-1965-1 is not recovered. It is not found. It is remembered into existence by necessity.</p>
