            <p>All hospitals and medical facilities worldwide are to be monitored for reports of unusual brain morphology, particularly abnormal developments in the parietal lobe. Foundation agents embedded in neonatal care units are to perform discreet testing using Document 1300-M procedural guidelines. Any identified SCP-1300-A instances are to be transferred to Foundation custody under the guise of rare medical research programs.</p>
            
            <p>Identified SCP-1300-A instances are to be kept in windowless containment chambers with no fewer than three (3) solid doors separating the subject from any exterior wall. Walls, ceilings, and floors must be lined with lead sheeting no less than 3 cm thick, overlaid with black felt. All light sources within containment must be filtered through specialized red glass manufactured at Site-19. No reflective surfaces are permitted within containment areas.</p>
            
            <p>All personnel interacting with SCP-1300-A instances must wear standard-issue blackout blindfolds. Personnel may only remove blindfolds once all doors to the containment chamber are sealed. Security personnel are to be stationed outside each door with instructions to terminate any staff attempting to exit without proper decontamination procedures.</p>
            
            <p>In the event of SCP-1300-B manifestation indicators (subject distress, followed by sudden temperature drop of 8°C or greater and static discharge), all personnel are to don blindfolds immediately and evacuate via predetermined routes marked with tactile floor indicators. No staff member is to open their eyes until reaching designated safe zones.</p>
            
            <p>Cover story "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome" is to be maintained through Foundation influence in medical research institutions. All SCP-1300-related fatalities are to be officially classified as SIDS cases, with Foundation agents performing necessary modifications to autopsy findings.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Description:</div>
            <p>SCP-1300 refers to a genetic mutation affecting approximately 1 in 2,500 human infants worldwide. This mutation manifests physically as SCP-1300-A, an anomalous structure within the parietal lobe of the brain, specifically in the areas responsible for visual processing and sensory integration. SCP-1300-A appears as a heavily folded, purplish tissue mass approximately 0.8 cm in diameter, embedded within normal brain tissue.</p>
            
            <p>Subjects possessing SCP-1300-A demonstrate the ability to perceive a significantly wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum than baseline humans. Testing confirms affected individuals can detect radiation ranging from low-frequency radio waves (≈3 kHz) to high-frequency gamma radiation (≈300 EHz). This expanded perception manifests as additional "colors" and visual elements that subjects struggle to describe to non-affected individuals.</p>
            
            <p>The anomalous properties of SCP-1300 typically activate between 2-4 months after birth, coinciding with the development of more complex visual processing capabilities. Upon activation, SCP-1300-A subjects invariably report perceiving entities designated as SCP-1300-B.</p>
            
            <p>SCP-1300-B entities are imperceptible to humans without the SCP-1300-A mutation. Descriptions from affected subjects prior to expiration are remarkably consistent despite subjects having no prior contact. SCP-1300-B is described as a figure of indeterminate gender with human-like features that appear slightly "wrong" in ways subjects struggle to articulate. Most subjects describe the entity as having a face that seems familiar yet unrecognizable, with expressions that suggest an unsettling curiosity. The entity appears ordinary at first glance, but prolonged observation reveals subtle anatomical impossibilities—proportions that quietly violate human anatomy without drawing immediate notice.</p>
            
            <p>Upon initial perception by an SCP-1300-A subject, SCP-1300-B does not immediately acknowledge awareness. Subjects report first noticing the entity in crowded areas or domestic settings, often partially obscured or at a distance. The entity will gradually position itself in increasingly proximate locations to the subject over a period of hours or days, never directly approaching but always managing to appear in places where the subject will inevitably encounter it.</p>
            
            <p>As observation continues, SCP-1300-B begins to exhibit awareness of being perceived. It will be found in increasingly private or intimate spaces—first appearing in public spaces frequented by the subject, then visible through windows, and eventually within the subject's home. The entity maintains a pretense of natural presence, often appearing to engage in mundane activities that contextually fit its surroundings. When directly confronted or addressed, SCP-1300-B does not respond but will be absent upon the subject's next observation of the area.</p>
            
            <p>The entity's method of traversal remains unknown; no surveillance has captured its actual movement between locations. Despite extensive containment measures including sealed rooms and constant observation, SCP-1300-B inevitably manifests in proximity to the subject. The entity appears exclusively interested in subjects possessing the SCP-1300-A mutation and has never been observed interacting with normal humans or inanimate objects.</p>
            
            <p>Testing with various recording devices has yielded inconsistent results, with most showing nothing at all. In rare successful captures, SCP-1300-B appears only as a visual distortion or blur that technical staff have been unable to enhance or clarify. All recording equipment that successfully captured even partial images of SCP-1300-B ceased functioning within 24 hours.</p>
            
            <p>Termination of SCP-1300-A subjects occurs between 6-72 hours after initial SCP-1300-B perception. During this period, subjects display increasing anxiety, followed by periods of catatonia during which they fixate on empty areas of the room. In the final stages, subjects often report sensing SCP-1300-B directly behind them, though no observers can detect its presence.</p>
            
            <p>Post-mortem examination by Foundation pathologists reveals signs of asphyxiation consistent with strangulation, though the indicators are atypical and easily overlooked by standard medical examiners. Pressure marks appear subdermally rather than on the skin surface, with microscopic tissue damage suggesting application of pressure from multiple directions simultaneously. This unusual pattern creates a strangulation effect that resembles natural respiratory failure to non-specialized medical personnel.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, microscopic analysis shows complete cessation of all electrical activity in the brain, with particular deterioration of the SCP-1300-A structure. The SCP-1300-A tissue is invariably found to be missing approximately 0.8 grams of neural matter, with no discernible extraction point or surgical marking. This precise removal of tissue has allowed Foundation researchers to maintain the "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome" cover story effectively, as standard autopsies rarely include the detailed brain tissue examination that would detect such anomalies.</p>
            
            <p>Prior to Foundation intervention, approximately 90% of all SCP-1300 cases were misdiagnosed as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The Foundation has maintained this cover story to prevent public awareness of SCP-1300. Current statistics suggest the Foundation successfully identifies and contains approximately 73% of all SCP-1300-A cases before manifestation of SCP-1300-B.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 1300-1: Incident Report</div>
                
                <p>On <span class="redacted">██/██/20██</span>, Researcher Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> was exposed to experimental compound SCP-<span class="redacted">████</span> during a containment breach. Subsequent medical examination revealed the spontaneous development of an SCP-1300-A-like structure in his parietal lobe. Unlike typical SCP-1300-A instances, Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> maintained conscious awareness of his expanded perception capabilities.</p>
                
                <p>During a controlled test, Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> immediately reported seeing an SCP-1300-B entity approximately 30 meters from the testing facility. Before containment procedures could be implemented, Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span> reported the entity moving toward him at high speed. Despite emergency protocols, SCP-1300-B manifested within the testing chamber within 4.3 seconds.</p>
                
                <p>Prior to expiration, Dr. <span class="redacted">██████</span>'s final transmission was recorded as follows:</p>

                <p>Analysis of historical medical records has revealed potential SCP-1300 cases dating back to ancient times. Multiple civilizations have documented infant deaths matching SCP-1300 patterns, often attributing them to supernatural entities. Of particular interest are Norse references to "shadow-takers," Egyptian hieroglyphs depicting "unseen harvesters," and medieval European accounts of "cradle-stalkers."</p>
                
                <p>Foundation researchers have hypothesized that SCP-1300-A may represent an evolutionary adaptation to detect SCP-1300-B entities, rather than the mutation itself being the primary anomaly. This hypothesis remains unproven.</p>

                <div class="addendum-title">Addendum 1300-3: Containment Update</div>
                
                <p>As of <span class="redacted">██/██/20██</span>, the Foundation has adapted ancient ritual practices discovered in [REDACTED] monastery scrolls that temporarily grant limited SCP-1300-A perception capabilities. A specialized unit, MTF Tau-9 ("Seers"), undergoes extensive preparation involving sensory deprivation, ingestion of specific herbal compounds, and exposure to carefully controlled auditory patterns to achieve this state.</p>
                
                <p>MTF Tau-9 operators can only maintain this perceptive state for a maximum of 3 minutes and must be blindfolded and sedated immediately afterward. Following each operation, all MTF Tau-9 members undergo mandatory surgical blinding procedures. The procedure removes the eyes but preserves the optic nerve to allow for prosthetic replacements after a quarantine period of 30 days. During this period, operators remain in complete darkness under medical supervision.</p>
                
                <p>MTF Tau-9 operatives describe approximately <span class="redacted">███</span> SCP-1300-B entities worldwide, with higher concentrations near population centers. All attempts to interact with SCP-1300-B entities have resulted in operator casualties despite protective measures.</p>
                
                <p>Note: Following Incident 1300-Theta, all MTF Tau-9 members are now required to undergo amnestic treatment following their recovery period. The use of mechanical recording devices during SCP-1300-B observation is strictly prohibited following the events at Site-23.</p>

                <p>On <span class="redacted">██/██/20██</span>, MTF Tau-9 Operative <span class="redacted">████████</span> volunteered for a second perceptive procedure despite protocol forbidding multiple exposures. Subject cited "unshakable feeling of being watched" and requested reassignment to active duty to "confirm suspicions."</p>
                
                <p>Operative <span class="redacted">████████</span> was granted special permission by Dr. <span class="redacted">███████</span> to undergo a second procedure. Mid-procedure, operative began exhibiting extreme distress, tearing at surgical bandages and attempting to communicate despite heavy sedation. Audio recording captured the following before emergency termination:</p>
                
                <div class="incident-log">
                    "They remember us. They remember who's seen them. They don't stop watching. Never stop. Something different happens after you see them twice. They start to—[DATA EXPUNGED]"
                </div>
                
                <p>Fourteen personnel involved in the procedure committed suicide within 72 hours. Three survivors were found catatonic, each having attempted to remove their own eyes with improvised implements.</p>
                
                <p>MTF Tau-9 has been permanently disbanded and Protocol DARK VISION has been suspended indefinitely. All personnel with knowledge of SCP-1300-B appearance have been placed under lifetime surveillance.</p>

                    O5 NOTICE: Any MTF or research personnel reporting persistent sensations of being watched following exposure to SCP-1300 research materials are to be immediately quarantined and processed according to Protocol 1300-TERMINUS. No exceptions.
